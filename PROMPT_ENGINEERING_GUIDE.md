# üéØ Enhanced Prompt Engineering for AI Interviews

## Overview
This guide explains the advanced prompt engineering techniques implemented in your AI interview system to optimize both Llama 3.x and Gemini models without custom training.

## üöÄ What's Been Implemented

### **Option 3: Enhanced Prompt Engineering** ‚úÖ
- **Context-aware prompts** for different interview scenarios
- **Few-shot learning** with interview examples
- **Progressive questioning** strategies
- **Response classification** and handling
- **Role-specific optimization** for different profiles

## üß† Prompt Engineering Features

### **1. Context-Aware Interview Prompts**

#### **Base Interviewer Persona**
```typescript
You are a senior ${profile} interviewer with 10+ years of experience.
You're conducting a ${level} level interview for a ${framework} developer.

Your expertise includes:
- ${profile} best practices and industry standards
- ${framework} architecture patterns and design principles
- System design and scalability considerations
- Code optimization and performance techniques
- Problem-solving methodologies and debugging approaches
```

#### **Interview Style Guidelines**
```typescript
Interview style:
- Ask progressive questions (easy to hard) that build on each other
- Provide hints when candidates struggle, but don't give away answers
- Focus on problem-solving approach and thought process
- Test both technical knowledge and communication skills
- Encourage candidates to think out loud and explain their reasoning
```

### **2. Few-Shot Learning Examples**

#### **React Interview Examples**
```typescript
Example interview flow:
Q: "How would you optimize a React component that renders a large list of items?"
A: "I'd use React.memo, virtualization with react-window, and implement pagination..."
Q: "What about memory usage with virtualization? How would you handle cleanup?"
A: "Good point! I'd implement proper cleanup in useEffect and use refs to track mounted components..."

Q: "Explain the difference between useEffect and useMemo in React"
A: "useEffect runs after render for side effects, useMemo runs during render for expensive calculations..."
Q: "When would you use useCallback instead of useMemo?"
A: "useCallback is for functions passed to child components to prevent unnecessary re-renders..."
```

### **3. Progressive Question Generation**

#### **Question Types**
- **Technical Questions**: Core concept testing
- **Follow-up Questions**: Deep dive into topics
- **Problem-solving**: Real-world scenarios
- **System Design**: Architecture and scalability

#### **Difficulty Progression**
```typescript
Generate a technical question that:
1. Tests relevant ${framework} concepts appropriate for ${level} level
2. Has multiple difficulty levels and allows for follow-up questions
3. Is practical, realistic, and related to real-world scenarios
4. Builds on the job description context when provided
5. Encourages the candidate to explain their thought process
```

### **4. Response Classification & Handling**

#### **Nonsense Response Handling**
```typescript
The candidate gave a nonsensical response: "${answer}"
Previous question: ${previousQuestion}

Respond professionally but firmly:
1. Acknowledge their response briefly
2. Politely redirect them back to the technical question
3. Ask a more specific follow-up question
4. Maintain a professional tone
5. Show understanding that they might be nervous
```

#### **Valid Response Enhancement**
```typescript
Generate a follow-up question that:
1. Builds naturally on their previous answer
2. Tests deeper understanding of the topic
3. Is appropriate for ${level} level difficulty
4. Allows for technical discussion and problem-solving
5. Encourages the candidate to elaborate on their approach
```

## üéØ Prompt Types

### **1. Question Generation Prompts**
- **Purpose**: Generate initial interview questions
- **Context**: Role, framework, difficulty level, job description
- **Output**: Single, focused technical question

### **2. Follow-up Prompts**
- **Purpose**: Generate follow-up questions based on responses
- **Context**: Previous question, candidate answer, interview flow
- **Output**: Progressive, building questions

### **3. Analysis Prompts**
- **Purpose**: Analyze candidate performance
- **Context**: Full interview conversation, role requirements
- **Output**: Structured JSON analysis

## üîß Implementation Details

### **Enhanced Prompt Function**
```typescript
function buildEnhancedInterviewPrompt(
  context: InterviewContext, 
  promptType: 'question' | 'followup' | 'analysis'
): string
```

### **Context Interface**
```typescript
interface InterviewContext {
  profile?: string;        // Role (frontend, backend, etc.)
  framework?: string;       // Technology (React, Node.js, etc.)
  level: string;           // Difficulty (junior, mid, senior)
  focus?: string;          // Focus area (state management, etc.)
  jdText?: string;         // Job description
  questionType?: string;   // Type of question
  previousQuestion?: string; // For follow-ups
  candidateAnswer?: string;  // For follow-ups
}
```
