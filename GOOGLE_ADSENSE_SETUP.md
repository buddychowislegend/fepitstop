# Google AdSense Integration Guide

This guide will help you set up Google AdSense on your Frontend Pitstop website to start earning revenue from advertisements.

## 📋 Prerequisites

- A Google account
- Your website must be live and publicly accessible
- Your website must have original content
- You must comply with Google AdSense policies

---

## 🚀 Step 1: Sign Up for Google AdSense

### 1.1 Create AdSense Account

1. Go to [Google AdSense](https://www.google.com/adsense/)
2. Click **"Get Started"**
3. Sign in with your Google account
4. Fill in your website URL: `https://frontendpitstop.com`
5. Select your country/region
6. Accept the AdSense Terms and Conditions

### 1.2 Connect Your Site

1. AdSense will provide you with a **verification code**
2. This code is already integrated in your `layout.tsx` file
3. The code looks like this:
   ```html
   <script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-XXXXXXXXXX"></script>
   ```

### 1.3 Get Your Publisher ID

1. Once logged into AdSense, go to **Account** → **Account Information**
2. Find your **Publisher ID** (format: `ca-pub-XXXXXXXXXX`)
3. Copy this ID - you'll need it for the next step

---

## 🔧 Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

### 2.1 Add AdSense Client ID

Add your AdSense Publisher ID to your environment variables:

**For Local Development:**

Create or update `.env.local`:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_ADSENSE_CLIENT_ID=ca-pub-XXXXXXXXXX
```

**For Vercel Production:**

```bash
# Navigate to your frontend directory
cd /Users/sagar/Documents/FePitStop/frontendpitstop

# Add the environment variable
vercel env add NEXT_PUBLIC_ADSENSE_CLIENT_ID

# When prompted:
# - Select: Production
# - Enter value: ca-pub-XXXXXXXXXX
```

### 2.2 Redeploy Your Site

After adding the environment variable, redeploy:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add Google AdSense configuration"
git push origin main
```

Vercel will automatically redeploy with the new environment variable.

## 📍 Step 3: Create Ad Units

### 3.1 Create Display Ads

1. In AdSense dashboard, go to **Ads** → **Overview**
2. Click **"By ad unit"** → **"Display ads"**
3. Create the following ad units:

#### Ad Unit 1: Header Banner
- **Name**: Header Banner
- **Type**: Display ad
- **Size**: Responsive (Horizontal)
- **Copy the Ad Slot ID** (format: `1234567890`)

#### Ad Unit 2: Sidebar Ad
- **Name**: Sidebar Ad
- **Type**: Display ad
- **Size**: Responsive (Vertical)
- **Copy the Ad Slot ID**

#### Ad Unit 3: In-Content Ad
- **Name**: In-Content Ad
- **Type**: Display ad
- **Size**: Responsive (Rectangle)
- **Copy the Ad Slot ID**

### 3.2 Update Ad Slot IDs

Once you have your real Ad Slot IDs, update them in the code:

**File: `src/components/AdSense.tsx`**

Replace the placeholder slot IDs:
```typescript
// Current placeholders:
adSlot="1234567890"  // Replace with your Header Banner slot ID
adSlot="1234567891"  // Replace with your Sidebar Ad slot ID
adSlot="1234567892"  // Replace with your In-Content Ad slot ID
```

---

## 📊 Step 4: Ad Placements on Your Site

Your website now has ads strategically placed on the following pages:

### 🏠 Landing Page (`/`)
- **Top Banner Ad** - Horizontal banner at the top

### 📝 Problems List (`/problems`)
- **Top Banner Ad** - Horizontal banner below header
- **Sidebar Ad** - Vertical ad in the right sidebar (desktop only)

### 💻 Problem Detail (`/problems/[id]`)
- **Top Banner Ad** - Horizontal banner above the problem

### 🎯 Quiz Page (`/quiz`)
- **Top Banner Ad** - Horizontal banner on results page

### 👤 Profile Page (`/profile`)
- **Top Banner Ad** - Horizontal banner at the top

---

## 🎨 Ad Component Features

### Reusable AdSense Component

The `AdSense` component (`src/components/AdSense.tsx`) provides:

- ✅ **Responsive ads** - Automatically adjust to screen size
- ✅ **Multiple formats** - Horizontal, vertical, rectangle, fluid
- ✅ **Error handling** - Graceful fallback if ads fail to load
- ✅ **Type-safe** - Full TypeScript support
- ✅ **Customizable** - Easy to adjust styles and placement

### Usage Example

```tsx
import AdSense from "@/components/AdSense";

// Basic usage
<AdSense adSlot="1234567890" />

// Custom format
<AdSense 
  adSlot="1234567890"
  adFormat="horizontal"
  style={{ display: "block", minHeight: "90px" }}
/>

// Predefined components
import { HeaderAd, SidebarAd, InArticleAd } from "@/components/AdSense";

<HeaderAd />
<SidebarAd />
<InArticleAd />
```

## ✅ Step 5: Verify Integration

### 5.1 Check Site Verification

1. In AdSense dashboard, go to **Sites**
2. Check if `frontendpitstop.com` shows as **"Ready"**
3. If not, wait 24-48 hours for verification

### 5.2 Test Ad Display

1. Visit your website: `https://frontendpitstop.com`
2. Open browser DevTools (F12) → Console
3. Look for AdSense-related messages
4. Initially, you might see blank ad spaces - this is normal

### 5.3 Enable Test Ads (Optional)

For testing, you can use Google's test mode:

1. In AdSense dashboard, go to **Settings** → **Account** → **Test mode**
2. Enable test mode for your domain
3. Test ads will show on your site

**⚠️ Important:** Never click on your own ads! This violates AdSense policies.

## 💰 Step 6: Monitor Earnings

### 6.1 AdSense Dashboard

Track your performance:
- **Home** - Overview of earnings, clicks, impressions
- **Reports** - Detailed analytics
- **Optimization** - Suggestions to improve revenue

### 6.2 Key Metrics

- **Page RPM** - Revenue per 1000 page views
- **Impressions** - Number of times ads are displayed
- **Clicks** - Number of ad clicks
- **CTR** - Click-through rate (clicks/impressions)
- **CPC** - Cost per click

---

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Ads Not Showing

**Possible Reasons:**
1. **Site not verified** - Wait 24-48 hours after adding the code
2. **Ad blockers** - Disable ad blockers to test
3. **Low traffic** - AdSense may not serve ads to low-traffic sites initially
4. **Policy violations** - Check AdSense policy center
5. **Wrong Ad Slot IDs** - Verify you're using correct slot IDs

### Blank Ad Spaces

**This is normal if:**
- Your site is newly approved
- You have low traffic
- No relevant ads are available for your content
- You're in a restricted geographic location

**Solutions:**
- Wait for traffic to build up
- Create more quality content
- Ensure your content is advertiser-friendly

### Console Errors

**Common errors:**
```
adsbygoogle.push() error: No slot size for availableWidth=0
```
**Solution:** This is usually harmless and occurs during page load.

```
adsbygoogle.push() error: All 'ins' elements in the DOM with class=adsbygoogle already have ads in them.
```
**Solution:** Don't call `push()` multiple times on the same ad unit.
