Frontend interviews test:

- Frontend system design

## The Solution

I built **Frontend Pitstop** - a free platform specifically for frontend interview preparation.

- Google
- Meta (Facebook)

- Comprehensive test cases
- Multiple difficulty levels

### 3. Comprehensive Topics

## Tech Stack

Built with:
- **Frontend:** Next.js 14, React, TypeScript
- **Editor:** Monaco Editor (VS Code's editor)
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express
