Title: I built a free platform with 100+ frontend interview questions - would love your feedback!

Hey r/webdev!

I spent the last few months building Frontend Pitstop, a free platform to help developers prepare for frontend interviews.

# I Built Frontend Pitstop: A Free Platform for Frontend Interview Prep

## The Problem

Last year, I went through multiple frontend interviews at FAANG companies. I quickly realized that most coding interview platforms focus on algorithms and data structures, but frontend interviews are different.

Frontend interviews test:
- DOM manipulation
- Async JavaScript (Promises, async/await)
- React patterns and hooks
- CSS layouts and responsive design
- Frontend system design

## The Solution

I built **Frontend Pitstop** - a free platform specifically for frontend interview preparation.

üîó **Try it:** https://frontendpitstop.com

## Features

### 1. 100+ Real Interview Questions
Questions from actual interviews at:
- Google
- Meta (Facebook)
- Amazon
- Netflix
- Uber

### 2. Interactive Code Editor
- Write code directly in the browser
- Instant feedback
- Comprehensive test cases
- Multiple difficulty levels

### 3. Comprehensive Topics
- **JavaScript:** Closures, Promises, Async/Await, Prototypes
- **React:** Hooks, State Management, Component Patterns
- **CSS:** Flexbox, Grid, Responsive Design
- **System Design:** Frontend architecture, Performance

## Tech Stack

Built with:
- **Frontend:** Next.js 14, React, TypeScript
- **Editor:** Monaco Editor (VS Code's editor)
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Deployment:** Vercel

## Why It's Free

I believe interview prep shouldn't be behind a paywall. Everyone should have access to quality resources regardless of their financial situation.
